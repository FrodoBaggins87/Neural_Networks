# Machine_Learning 
This repository contains several projects on Machine Learning and Deep Learning, primarily using PyTorch. The projects range from basic implementations to advanced applications, including:

Basic Models: Linear regression, classification, and other foundational algorithms.
Computer Vision: Customizing pretrained models such as EfficientNet_B0 for image classification tasks using Transfer Learning.
Vision Transformers: Implemented a Vision Transformer model based on the ArXiV paper 'An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale'.
Additionally, I have compared the performance and size of different models, including EfficientNet_B0, EfficientNet_B2, and ViT_B12. The final model, based on EfficientNet_B12, has been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. You can try it out https://huggingface.co/spaces/FrodoBaggins87/Pizza_Steak_Sushi_Prediction
